To get this running please be on NodeJS version 8.0.0 and have NPM installed. Then to build contracts, you will need to install `ethdeploy`. To do that, run the following commands: 
```
npm install -g ethdeploy
npm install -g ethdeploy-environment-loader
npm install -g ethdeploy-solc-loader
npm install -g solc
```
Then to install the local deps., just run your good ol' `npm install`.

To build the contracts, launch a TestRPC and then run `npm build`. Now you's gucci.
